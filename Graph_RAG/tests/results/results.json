The second one clearly doesn't. The context doesn't mention any other hotels, so I can't recommend anything else. I should note that the embedding-based score seems like an outlier or error, but since my instructions say to use only the context, I'll ignore that interpretation. \n\nThe user probably wants a clear, concise answer. Since only one hotel qualifies, I'll present it in a bullet point as requested, highlighting its score and traveler ratings. I should also mention the low-score entry exists in context but doesn't meet the criteria, to show I considered all data. \n\nThe user might be planning a trip to Cairo - perhaps for leisure given the high family/couple scores. I'll keep the response factual but add that traveler-type detail since it could help them decide. No need to over-explain the score discrepancy unless asked.\n</think>\n\nBased strictly on the provided context:\n\n*   **Nile Grandeur** (avg_score=8.76) - This hotel has an average score above 8.

    "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants hotels in Cairo with an average score above 8. First, I need to look at the context provided. There are two sets of hotels: one from a baseline source and another from an embedding source. \n\nStarting with the baseline hotels, I see The Golden Oasis has an avg_score of 9.092. That's definitely above 8. Next, Canal House Grand at 9.090, Marina Bay Zenith at 9.053, The Bund Palace at 9.050, and Colosseum Gardens at 9.044. All these are well above 8. But wait, are these in Cairo? The names don't immediately suggest Cairo. The Golden Oasis might be, but others like Canal House Grand or Marina Bay Zenith sound like they could be elsewhere. Hmm, I need to be careful here. The context doesn't specify locations, so I should only recommend those explicitly mentioned as being in Cairo.\n\nLooking at the embedding results: Nile Grandeur has an avg_score of 0.767, which is below 8. The Golden Oasis appears again with 0.674, also below 8. The Bosphorus Inn, Tango Boutique, and Gaudi's Retreat all have scores below 8. So none of the embedding results meet the criteria.\n\nWait, the user specifically asked for hotels in Cairo. Among the baseline hotels, only Nile Grandeur mentions the Nile, which is in Cairo. The others like Marina Bay or The Bund Palace might not be in Cairo. So Nile Grandeur is the only one that fits both the location and the score above 8. But its score is 0.767, which is below 8. That's confusing. \n\nDouble-checking the context: Nile Grandeur is listed under embedding with a score of 0.767. The baseline hotels don't have any with \"Cairo\" in the name. So actually, none of the hotels meet both criteria: being in Cairo and having a score above 8. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that there are no hotels in Cairo above 8 in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nBased solely on the provided context:\n\n**No hotels in Cairo with an average score above 8 were found.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   The context lists hotels retrieved via \"baseline\" and \"embedding\" methods.\n*   **Nile Grandeur** is the only hotel explicitly associated with Cairo (via the Nile reference).\n*   Its average score (`0.767`) is **below 8**.\n*   The other hotels either have no clear Cairo association or scores below 8.\n\nTherefore, no hotels matching both criteria (located in Cairo *and* score > 8) are present in the given context.",

Hmm, the user is asking for hotels in Cairo with an average score above 8. Let me look at the context provided. There are two entries for ""Nile Grandeur"" but with different scores. The first one has an avg_score of 8.759, which is above 8, and it's from a baseline source. The second entry for the same hotel has a much lower score of 0.768 via embedding. 

I need to stick strictly to the context. The query specifies hotels above 8, so only the first Nile Grandeur meets that criteria. The second entry with 0.768 doesn't qualify. There are no other hotels mentioned in the context. 

The user might be looking for high-rated options in Cairo, possibly for a trip where quality is important. Since only one hotel meets the criteria, I'll present that clearly. I should mention the source (baseline) to be transparent about where the score comes from. 

I won't include the lower-scored entry since it's below 8 and the same hotel name. The answer should be concise and factual, listing just the qualifying hotel with its score and source.

Based strictly on the provided context:

- **Nile Grandeur** (avg_score=8.75969581749047)  
  *Justification: Matches your requirement for an average score above 8 (via baseline source).*

**Note:** Only one hotel entry in the context meets your criteria. The second ""Nile Grandeur"" entry (via embedding) has a score below 8 and is excluded.",,110,233

Hmm, the user is asking me to recommend three family-friendly hotels in Berlin. Let me check the context provided. I see that only one hotel is listed: Berlin Mitte Elite with an average score of 0.7449. There's no information about family-friendly amenities or other hotels in the context.

The user specifically wants three recommendations, but the context only contains one hotel. I should be precise and not make up any additional hotels. The instructions clearly state that I must not hallucinate facts not found in the context.

I need to politely explain that only one hotel is available in the context. I should mention Berlin Mitte Elite since it's the only retrieved option, but I must note that there's no information about its family-friendliness. The user might be traveling with children and looking for kid-friendly features like pools, play areas, or family rooms, but I can't confirm if this hotel offers those.

Since the context doesn't contain enough information to fulfill the request, I'll be transparent about the limitation. I'll structure my response to be helpful by providing the available hotel while acknowledging the gap. This maintains trust by adhering strictly to the context and avoiding speculation.
</think>

Based solely on the provided context, I can only recommend one hotel:

*   **Berlin Mitte Elite**: This is the only hotel retrieved in the context. (Average Score: 0.74)

**Important Note:** The context does not specify if Berlin Mitte Elite is family-friendly, nor does it contain information on any other hotels that would allow me to recommend three family-friendly options as requested.",,104,260

Hmm, the user is asking which hotels in Tokyo have excellent cleanliness. Let me check the context provided. 

Looking at the retrieved hotels, I see two entries for ""Kyo-to Grand"" with different average scores. The first one has a high avg_score of 8.969, marked as baseline, while the second has a much lower score of 0.717 from embedding. 

But wait - both entries are for ""Kyo-to Grand"", which seems like a misspelling of ""Kyoto Grand"". More importantly, Kyoto is not Tokyo! The user specifically asked for hotels in Tokyo, but this hotel appears to be in Kyoto instead. 

The context doesn't contain any hotels actually located in Tokyo. There are no other hotel names mentioned besides this Kyoto property. 

I should point out that while ""Kyo-to Grand"" has a high cleanliness score in one metric, it's not in the requested city. Since no Tokyo hotels appear in the context, I can't recommend any based on the given information. 

The user might be disappointed there are no Tokyo options, so I'll phrase the response politely to avoid frustration. I'll clearly state that no Tokyo hotels were found in the context while acknowledging the Kyoto hotel's high score isn't relevant to their query.
</think>

Based strictly on the provided context:

**No hotels in Tokyo with excellent cleanliness are found in the context.**

The context only lists one hotel:
- **Kyo-to Grand** (located in **Kyoto**, not Tokyo). It has two different average scores, but no information about its cleanliness is provided.

Since the context contains no information about hotels in Tokyo, I cannot recommend any based on the given data.",,110,268

Hmm, the user is asking about visa requirements for traveling from Egypt to Germany. Let me check the context provided. 

The retrieved hotels are Nile Grandeur in Egypt and Berlin Mitte Elite in Germany, but there's no mention of visa information. The context only includes hotel names and their average scores. 

I recall the instructions clearly state to only use the given context and not hallucinate any facts. Since visa requirements aren't addressed in the context at all, I can't provide an answer based on this information. 

The user might be planning a trip and trying to understand travel logistics between these two countries. While I can't help with visas here, they'd need to consult official government sources for accurate visa requirements. 

I should politely explain that this information isn't available in the current context while maintaining a helpful tone. The response should be concise and direct them to proper authorities without adding any unsupported details.
</think>

Based solely on the provided CONTEXT, I cannot answer your question about visa requirements for travel from Egypt to Germany.

The CONTEXT only lists two hotels (Nile Grandeur and Berlin Mitte Elite) and their average scores. It contains **no information** about travel visas, entry requirements, or any other travel regulations between Egypt and Germany.

For accurate visa information, please consult official sources like the German embassy in Egypt or the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",,114,233

Hmm, the user is asking for boutique hotels in Paris. Let me check the context provided. 

Okay, looking at the retrieved hotels, there's only one hotel mentioned: L'Étoile Palace. It appears twice with different average scores - one via baseline (8.94) and one via embedding (0.72). 

The context doesn't specify that this is a boutique hotel, but since it's the only hotel provided in the response, I have to work with what's given. The instructions are clear: I must use only the context and not hallucinate any information. 

I notice the scores are quite different between the two retrieval methods. That's interesting but not directly relevant to the boutique aspect. The user might be expecting more options, but the context only contains this single property. 

I should present this hotel as the only available option from the context, while being transparent about the lack of boutique designation. The response should be factual and avoid making assumptions about the hotel's style since the context doesn't confirm it's boutique. 

The user might be disappointed with just one result, but I have to strictly follow the context. I'll phrase the response to indicate this is the only hotel retrieved without claiming it meets the boutique criteria.
</think>

Based solely on the provided context, only one hotel is retrieved:

*   **L'Étoile Palace** - This hotel appears in the context (listed twice with different average scores). However, the context does **not** explicitly state that it is a boutique hotel.

No other hotels are mentioned in the context. Therefore, I cannot confirm any boutique hotels in Paris based *only* on this information.",,108,267

Hmm, the user is asking about the best hotels in Istanbul for business travelers. Let me check the context provided. 

Okay, the only hotel mentioned is The Bosphorus Inn with an average score of 0.772. The context doesn't specify any business amenities or suitability for business travelers. 

I notice the user specifically mentioned ""business travellers"" - they probably need hotels with meeting rooms, good WiFi, business centers, or convenient locations. But none of that information is in the context. 

The embedding retrieval only returned one hotel, which suggests either the query was too narrow or the database has limited options. I should be honest about the lack of business-specific details. 

The user might be disappointed getting just one option with no business features mentioned. Maybe they'll need to refine their query or look elsewhere. 

I'll stick to the facts: only one hotel is available in context, no business amenities are listed, and I'll politely suggest they might want to provide more details. No point pretending we have data we don't have.

Based solely on the provided context:

*   **The Bosphorus Inn** is the only hotel retrieved (with an average score of 0.77). However, the context does not mention any specific amenities, location details, or suitability for business travellers.

**Therefore, I cannot recommend any specific hotels for business travellers in Istanbul based on the information provided.** The context lacks details about business facilities, location convenience, or any features relevant to business travel needs.",,108,244
